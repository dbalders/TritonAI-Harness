# Organizing threads

Pin a thread from its context menu to keep it in the pinned section above your active work.
`mod+shift+p` pins or unpins the thread you have open. Pinned threads are shown independently of
their project, including when you connect to more than one environment.

To require confirmation before unpinning, enable **Settings → General → Unpin confirmation**. The
confirmation applies to the sidebar controls, thread menus, and the `mod+shift+p` shortcut.

Pinned threads still move to **Settled** when they become inactive. They also move when their pull
request merges if **Auto-settle merged threads** is enabled.

Each environment owns its automatic settlement settings. The server checks them even when no web,
desktop, or mobile client is connected. By default, it settles threads after three days without
activity and when their pull request merges. An eligible idle thread also settles when its pull
request closes. An open pull request blocks inactivity settlement. Active work, pending input, and
live background work keep the thread active. TritonAI Harness settles from a closed or merged pull request
only when its timestamp is not older than the user's latest activity. If that timestamp is not
available, the inactivity rule still applies. A manual un-settle also keeps the thread active.
Change these rules in **Settings > General** for the environment. A settings change affects future
settlement and does not reopen a settled thread. Settings saved by older clients on one device no
longer control this behavior.

When you un-settle a thread, it returns to the top of the active list so you can find it right
away. Its timestamps do not change. Other threads keep their positions.

Right-click a pull request link in a thread and choose **Link to thread** to show that pull request
in the sidebar. The thread settles when the linked pull request merges if **Auto-settle merged
threads** is enabled. Right-click the same link and choose **Unlink from thread** to remove it.

On web and desktop, drag a pinned thread to change its position. On mobile, open the thread's menu
and choose **Move up** or **Move down**. The order is stored by the server and appears on your
other connected devices.

If reordering is unavailable for one environment, update the T3 Code server running in that
environment. Older servers can still pin and unpin threads, but do not understand synced ordering;
their pinned threads keep the default newest-first order below the ones you have arranged.

Active threads are grouped by project on web and desktop. Projects follow your project sort setting:
your saved order when sorting is manual, and most recent activity otherwise. Each project shows its
most recently active thread first. Use the project filter above the list to focus the sidebar on one
project. Branch, provider, and environment details remain available by hovering a thread without
taking up space in every row.

Unsent drafts appear in a separate **Draft threads** section above Active threads. The section is
hidden when there are no saved drafts, keeping draft work distinct from submitted threads.
