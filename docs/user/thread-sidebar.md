# Working with threads

Use a new thread for a separate task. Choose **New worktree** when its code changes
need a separate branch and working directory.

## Start a thread

On web and desktop, a new thread keeps the current project and carries your model
and mode selections, unless the destination project has its own model default.
Its branch and workspace mode come from your configured defaults. To continue in
an existing worktree, use **New thread in this worktree** from the branch toolbar.

When you change a new thread's project, TritonAI Harness stays in the current environment
if that project exists there. Otherwise it selects an environment that has it.

### Start in the background

In a desktop browser or the desktop app, press `Cmd+Enter` on macOS or `Ctrl+Enter`
on Windows and Linux to start a new thread and immediately open another draft. The
next draft keeps the workspace mode and base branch you selected. With **New
worktree**, each background submission creates its own worktree.

## Pin and reorder threads

Pin a thread from its menu to keep it above your active work.

On web and desktop, you can also drag files from your computer onto any thread row:
the thread opens and the files are attached in its composer, ready for
your next message. The same per-message file limits apply as when attaching
files directly; see [Attach files](./composer.md#attach-files).

On web and desktop, pinning or unpinning a thread keeps the sidebar at your current
scroll position instead of following the thread to its new place in the list.

Pinned threads can still be marked done automatically. Marking a thread done removes its pin.

On web and desktop, drag a thread between sections to change its state. Drag a thread up into
the pinned section to pin it at the spot you drop it; drag a pinned thread down into the active
list to unpin it. Dragging a thread onto the **Done** header marks it done, and dragging a done
thread into the active list reopens it. A snoozed thread can be dragged out of the snoozed
shelf, which wakes it, but threads cannot be dragged into the shelf because snoozing needs a wake
time. Dragging a pinned thread out of the pinned section does not ask for unpin confirmation.
Pinned and active boundary labels appear only while dragging, without moving the rows. The
other rows slide aside to show where the thread will land. When you cross into another section,
the dragged thread shows the action the drop performs, with its icon: **Pin**, **Unpin**,
**Done**, **Reopen**, or **Wake**. Its status and hover actions hide during the drag. A pinned
thread keeps its pin only while it stays in the pinned section; once it leaves, the badge takes
over. Reordering within the same section shows no badge. When there are no pins, drag to the top
edge to pin a thread. Section labels stay readable for the whole drag, and the section the
thread is over takes the accent color. Section labels also
identify empty sections and a collapsed Done shelf.

Drag within the pinned or active section to change its order. Other rows slide aside to show the
spot where the thread will land. Drops into either section keep the position you choose. On
mobile, open a thread's menu and choose **Arrange threads**. Drag a handle within or between
**Pinned** and **Active** to reorder, pin, or unpin. Drop onto the **Done** divider to
mark a thread done. The dragged card shows the action before you release it. Expand **Snoozed**
or **Done** to drag a parked thread back into either live section. Each drop saves; **Done** returns to the thread list.
**Move up** and **Move down** are also available in the thread menu. The server
saves the order, so it survives a refresh and appears on your other connected devices.

On web and desktop, the list also animates section changes made with thread actions such as
**Pin**, **Done**, and **Snooze**. These transitions respect your system's reduced-motion
preference. While dragging, rows follow the insertion gap without replaying a second transition
after the drop.

New threads appear above the active threads you have arranged. Marking a thread done clears its active
position, so using **Reopen** returns it to the top. Pinning and snoozing preserve its active
position until you move it again. Thread activity does not change the order. The Done shelf
continues to use the time each thread was marked done.

If dragging is unavailable for one environment, update the TritonAI Harness server running in that
environment. Pinned and active reordering require server support. Threads from older servers keep
their default order until the server is updated.

## Done with a thread

Choose **Done** from its menu to move finished work out of the active list
without deleting the conversation. **Reopen thread** restores it to active work
and keeps it active until new activity resumes the automatic rules.
Manually marking an idle thread done dismisses unanswered async questions without
sending an answer or restarting the agent.

By default, environments mark inactive threads done after fourteen days and mark
threads done when their pull request merges. A closed pull request can also mark an idle
thread done. Work in progress, pending questions or approvals, and live background work
keep the thread active. An open pull request also keeps an inactive thread active,
but an old closed or merged pull request does not mark work done that you resumed
after it closed.

Change these rules in **Settings → General**. They continue to run when your apps
are closed. On web and desktop, choose an environment at the top to change only
its rules, or **All environments** to update connected environments together.
Mixed values show where the selected environments disagree. Mobile applies these
rules to connected environments that support shared settings. Offline environments
and older servers keep their previous values. Changing a rule does not reopen
threads already marked done.

## Link a pull request

The server finds the PR for each active thread's saved branch, even when your
apps are closed. Done threads keep their saved links. Update the server if
automatic branch links do not appear.

On web and desktop, right-click a pull request link in a thread and choose
**Link to thread** to select a different PR. Use **Unlink from thread** on the
same link to return to the branch PR, if one exists.
The linked pull request helps determine when a thread is marked done automatically.

## Find and reference work

On web and desktop, open the command palette with `Cmd/Ctrl+K` to search threads
across connected environments. Message search starts after two characters and
includes your messages and final agent responses.

Use **Settings → Keybindings** to find or customize shortcuts for searching files
and copying a thread reference. A copied reference uses the thread's pull request
link when available, otherwise its thread ID. See [keybindings](./keybindings.md)
for custom configuration.

## Inspect agent work

On web and desktop, use **Agents** to follow work delegated to subagents.

Expand a tool call in the conversation to see its full command and output.
Summaries shorten shell wrappers and can still describe the latest call after it
finishes; the call's own result shows its status.

## Snooze until later

Choose **Snooze → Custom…** from a thread's menu to pick a date and time in your
local time zone, or a duration in minutes, hours, or days. Durations start when
you confirm; one day means 24 hours. On web and desktop, you can also snooze
several selected threads together. Choose **Wake thread** to bring a thread back early.

## Nightly appearance

Nightly builds show a starry sidebar header, including with the UC San Diego theme.
The `(Nightly)` label appears as text with a transparent background.
Use **Settings → Appearance → Environment identification** to choose artwork, a pill, or neither.
